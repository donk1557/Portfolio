# Portfolio

This is the makings of my portfolio. There are a lot of placeholder texts and images just to the display the overall look of the page. All the titled images of the applications in the My Projects section do hyperlink to the code refactor for Horiseon. The navbar has links to sections of the page and a border frame for a future profile picture but, the items in the Contact Me section don't do anything yet. In due time, sections will be filled out, images replaced, and project applications modified as well as added too.

Here is the link to the portfolio: https://donk1557.github.io/Portfolio/
